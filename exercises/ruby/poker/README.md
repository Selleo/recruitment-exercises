Ruby: 2.4+ (feel free to use any ruby version you want)

E.g.

```
rvm use 2.4.0@conundrum --create
gem install rspec
gem install require_all
rspec <insert path to your specs here>
```

Usual tasks:

- Write implementation so all tests are green
- Focus on code quality/readability/simplicity
- Do not modify tests (sample implementation was written, so test are 99.99% ok and implementable)

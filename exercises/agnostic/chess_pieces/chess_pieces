# ChessPieces

Goal of exercise is to implement all of the chess pieces except pawns.
(If you don't know how they move look here -> https://www.chessable.com/blog/how-the-chess-pieces-move/). Please assume orginal chessboard size (8x8).

I would like to see all possible moves of piece I type (with starting position).
For example:
```Bishop.new('b2') ``` should output all of the possible moves for bishop from b2 square. ```[a1, a3, c1, c3, d4, e5, f6, g7, h8]```.

Important notes:
1) Use TDD
2) Do not overcomplicate it
3) Each piece should be commited in separete commit with good commit description, 'asd' and 'work in progress' is not acceptable.
4*) Visualize the movement of pieces using text format, for example:


```
o o o o o o o o
o o o o o o o o
o o o o o o o o
o o o x x x o o
o o o x K x o o
o o o x x x o o
o o o o o o o o
o o o o o o o o

K - king
x - possible moves
```
